# InvestorTime
---
InvestorTime is a Ruby on Rails stock tracker and portfolio application to manage your stock portfolio. It uses Devise for authentication, search forms, Ajax, Javascript, external API usage, secure credentials management, and rapid prototyping. 

# Motivation
---
Social media is an industry I am fascinated with because of it's ability to empower users to be their own brand and make connections worldwide. I wanted to understand the functionality behind the various components that are implemented in these platforms by building them out in this app. With this app in particular I wanted to explore utilizing clean OOP principles to create an application that shows mastery of Ruby on Rails while extracting data from an external API.

# Tehcnologies Used
---
# - Ruby on Rails
  Ruby is a flexible OOP language that allowed me to execute a proof of concept fairly quickly. Rails is a development framework which makes abstracting out tasks much easier and allows me to DRY up my code. Allowed me to easily add unit, integration, and functional tests.
# - Postgresql
  Postgresql is a program that allows me to easily create a relational database and view my data in clear and distinct tables.
# - Stock API
  Leveraged the Stock API so I could easily extract large subsets of data to track and manage stock portfolios.
# - Bootstrap
  Implemented StimulusJS for a quick, lightweight, and dynamic interface.
# - Devise and Bcyrpt
  For an out of the box authentication and authorization of users, Devise was used. Bcrypt was used to help hide passwords.
